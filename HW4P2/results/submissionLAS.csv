292,THE ATMOSPHERE AS EVIDENTLY CHARGED IN SIR CHARGE WITH LECTURICITY
293,THE WIND NEVER LOLES BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASE STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESEPARE OF FEARFUL WINDE GUESTS IN RUSHING STORMS
294,THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE CORIZON
295,THOSE CLOUDS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING A CRUSHED THE SEA
296,ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMINOUS SENITIBLE'S FIRE THE OUSTRICT SILL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE HEAT OF LAD
297,BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
298,THAT WILL BE THE SAFEST NO NO NOTHER
299,THE POWD OF VAPOURS CONTENTS IN A WATER AND THE AIR PUT IN THE VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE BACK HIM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MIST ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
300,HARN STIRS NOT
301,FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THEIR CONTINUAL ADMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT THE LECTURED MATTER IS AN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLICULES THE GASIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR HE TO BE SLAIGHT WITH MOISTURE FOR INNERMABLE COLUMNS OF WIRE RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
302,I REFERRED THE THEMOMETER IT IN ICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
303,IS THE ATMOSPHERE CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED DISTENSITY TO BECOME FINAL
304,THE WRATH BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
305,AT NOON THE VALANCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
306,HE CHIVES IS LASHED IS SOME PART OF THE RAFT
307,THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS
308,THEY SEEMED TO BEAT WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
309,HE NAUGHTS HIS CONSENT
310,THE FAR BALL HALF OF IT WHY HALF AZZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN IT SHILL MOVED SOLELY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VEHILOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
311,HERE IT COMES THEIR ICLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUP OF THE MAST THAT'S IT LIGHTLY LEAVES ON THE PROVISION BAY DESTANDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZIE HORRIBLE
312,WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLY LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HARNS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON ITS SETILE IT THREAD IS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT

335,WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF HE'D RATHER NOT WE INDEED
336,OUT IN THE WOODS STOOD A NICE LITTLE FIRTRE
337,THE PLACE HE HAD WAS A VERY GOOD ONE THE SUN SHONE ON HIM AS TO FRESH AIR THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THAT AND ROUND HIM GREW MANY LARGE SIZED COMRADES PINE MISSUS WELL AS FURS
338,HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SON AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ABOUT AND PRATTLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERRIES
339,BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
340,IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY LITTERING ON THE GROUND A HAIR WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUNC RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE
341,OH THAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY
342,TO GROW AND GROW TO GET OLD TER AND BEAT HALL THOUGHT THE TREE THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST STOMALIGHT FOOL THING IN THE WORLD
343,IN AUTUMN WHO WOULD CUT HERS ALWAYS CAME AND FELT SOME OF THE LARGEST TREES
344,THIS HAPPENED EVERY YEAR AND THE YOUNG FIR TREE THAT HAD NOW GROWN TO A VERY COMELY SIZE TREMBLED AT THE SIGHT FOR THE MAGNIFICENT GREAT TREES FELL TO THE EARTH WITH NOISE AND CRACKY THE BRANCHES WERE LOCKED OFF AND THE TREES LOOKED LONG AND BEAR THEY WERE HARDLY TO BE RECOGNIZED AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARPS AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARPS AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARPS AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARPS AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARPS AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARPS AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARPS AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARPS AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARPS AND THEN THEY WERE LA

353,SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDEUR MUST FOLLOW BUT WHAT
354,WE CHOICE IN ARE PRESENCE SAID THE AIR AND THE SUNLIGHT
355,RED JOYCE IN MY OWN FRESH YOU
356,BUT THE TREE DID NOT REJOICE AT ALL HE GREW AND GREW AND WAS GREEN BOTH WINTER AND SUMMER
357,AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CUT DOWN
358,THE AXE STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELT IN THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG AND WAS LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS BUT HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP
359,HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES A LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND TO MANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS
360,THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
361,THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
362,THERE ARE TWO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WITH HUNDREDS INTO HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
363,THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED IT
364,THIS EVENING THEY ALL SAID
365,HOW IT WILL SHINE THIS EVENING
366,PERHAPS THE OTHER TREES FROM THE FORESTS WILL CONTAL GOOD ME
367,IT PLAYSD UP FAMOUSLY HELP HELP
368,CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE
369,A STORY
370,A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING A LITTLE FAT AND MAN TOWARDS THE TREE
371,BUT I SHALL TELL ONELY ONE STORY
372,H'M I DON'T BE FELL DOWNSTAIRS AND YEAH MARRY THE PRINCESS
373,THAT'S THE WAY OF TWORLD
374,WELL WELL
375,I WON'T TREMBLE TO MORROW THOUGHT THE FIR TREE
376,AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
377,IN THE MORNING THE SERVANTS AND THE HOUSE MADE CAME IN
378,BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IT A DARK ACCORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
379,WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS BOUGHT THE TREE
380,AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERY
381,TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOME BUT HE DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
382,IS NOW A WINTER OUT OF DOORS THOUGHT THE TREE
383,HOW KIND MAN IS AFTER ALL
384,IF DON'T THEY WERE NOT SO DARK HERE IN SO TERRIBLY LONELY
385,SPEAK AND SCRITIC
386,THEY SNUFFED ABOUT THE FIR TREE AND RUSTLED AMONG THE BRANCHES
387,I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE FIR TREE
388,THERE'S MEDDY A ONE CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN I AM
389,THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY CURIOUS
390,I KNOW KNOWS SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE
391,AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID
392,SAID THE FIRST RY THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF RELATED
393,YES IN REALITY THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES
394,WHO IS UNPINK DON'T P  ASKED THE MICE
395,ONLY THAT ONE ANSWERED THE TREE
396,IT IS A VERY STUPID STORY
397,DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BICON THAN CAVALCANDOLES CANST JUTHO ANY LODDER STORY IS
398,NO SAID THE TREE
399,THEN GOOD BY SAID THE REPTS AND THEY WENT HOME
400,AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE SIDE AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEK LITTLE MIGHT SAT ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM
401,NOW THAT TOO WAS OVER
402,WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT
403,THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE
404,BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THE BIG MAN'S
405,IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES
406,THE GOLD AND STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
407,IN THE COURT YARD SOME OF THE MARRIAGE CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
408,AND THE GARDENER'S BOY SHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE
409,THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDID LAY UNDER THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND IT SIGHED SO DEEPLY
410,HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY HAS AN END
411,ALL IT SET WITHOUT A WORD
412,I SAID THE NEAT THI LOOKS AS CHILDREN DO IN THE NOON SON WITH SOULS THAT TREMBLE THROUGH THEIR HAPPY ISLANDS FROM AN UNFERRED YET PRODICAL INWARD JOY
413,I DID NOT WRONG MYSELF SO BUT I PLACED A WRONG ON THEE
414,WHEN CALLED BEFORE I TOLD HOW HASTILY I DROPPED MY FLOWERS OR BREAK OFF FROM A GAME
415,SHALL I NEVER MISS HOME TALK AND BLESSING AND THE COMMON KITS THAT COMES TO EACH IN TURN NOR COUNTED STRANGE WHEN I LOOK UP TO DRAW ON A NEW RANGE OF WALLS AND FLOORS ANOTHER HOME THAN THIS

417,OPEN THY HEART WARITE AND FOLD WITHIN THE WET WEEKNS OF THY DOTH
418,GOOD IT MEAN TO LAST A LOVE SET PENGELESS BETWEEN SORROW AND SORROW
419,NAY AY RATHER THRILL DISTRESSING EVERY LIGHT IT SEEMED TO GILL BEYONWARD PATH AND FEAR TO OVERLEAN A FINGER EVEN
420,AND THOUGH I HAVE GROWN SERENE AND STRONG SINCE THEN I THINK THEY GOT HIS WILL A STILL RENEWABLE FEAR
421,A LUFT O TROTH
422,AND LOVE BE FALTS
423,IF HE TO KEEP ONE OATH MUCH LOSE ONE JOY BY HIS LIFES STAR FOR TOLL
424,SLOW TO WORLD GREETINGS QUICK WITH ITS O LIST WHEN THE ANGEL SPEAK
425,A RING OF AMITHIST I COULD NOT WEAR HERE PLAIN OR TO MY SIGHT THAN THAT FIRST KISS
426,THAT WAS THE CHRISTMA OF LOVE WHICH LOVE'S OWN CROWN WITH SANK TO FINE SWEETNESS DID PERCEIVE THE THIRD UPON MY WITS WAS FOLDED DOWN AND PERFECT PURPLE STATE SINCE WHEN INDEED I HAVE BEEN PROUD AND SAID MY LOVE MY OWN
427,DEAREST TEACH ME SO TO POUR OUT GRATITUDE AS THOU DUST GOOD

429,BUT THOU ART NOT SUCH A LOVER MIGHT BELOVED
430,THOU CANST WEIGHT THROUGH SORROW IN SICKNESS TO BRING SOULS TO TOUCH AND THINK IT SOON WHEN OTHERS CRY TOO LEAD
431,I THINK ALL WHO HAD LOVED ME IN THEIR HEARTS WITH THANKS AND LOVE FROM MINE
432,OH TO SHOOT MY SOULS FULL MEANING INTO FUTURE YEARS THAT THEY SHOULD OCLAND IN UTTERANCE AND SALUTE LOVE THAT ENDURES FROM LIFE THAT DISAPPEARS
433,THEN I LONG TRIED BY NATURAL OLDS RECEIVED THE COMFORT FAST WHILE BUDDING AT DIE SIGHT TO MY PILGRIM STAFF GAVE OUT GREEN BLEEVES WITH MORNING DEWS IMPEARL

437,TO FADE AWAY LIKE MORNING BEAUTY FROM HER MORTAL DAY DOWN BY THE RIVER OF A DONNER HER SOFT VOICES HEARD AND THUS HER GENTLE LAMENTATION FALLS LIKE MORNING DO
438,O LIFE OF THIS OUR SPRING
439,WHY FADES THE LOTICE OF THE WATER

441,FELL IS LIKE A WATCHERY BOAW AND LIKE APARTING CLOUD LIKE A REFLECTION IN A GLANCE WHIKE SHADOWS IN THE WATCHER LIKE DREAMS OF INFANCE LIKE A SMILE UPON IT IN FINCE FACE
442,LIKE THE DUB'S VOICE LIKE TRANSIENT DAY LIKE A MUSIC IN THE AIR AH
443,AND GENTLE SLEEP THE SLEEP OF DEATH AND JETTILY HEAR THE VOICE OF HIM THAT WALKET IN THE GARDEN IN THE EVENING TIME
444,THE LILY OF THE VALLEY BREATHING IN THE HUMBLE GRASS ANSWERED THE LOVE WE MADE HAD SAID I AVE WATERY WEED AND I AM VERY SMALL IN LOVE TO TWELVE AND LOWLY VIGOLS SO WEAK THE GILDED BUTTERFLY SCARCE PERCHES ON MY HEAD YET I AM VISITED FROM HEAVEN AND EACH MORN OVER ME SPREADS HIS HAND SAYING REJOICE THOU HUMBLE GRASS THOU NEW WORN LILY FLOWER
445,THOU GENTLE MADE OF SILENT VALLEYS AND OF MODEST BROOKS FOR THOU SHALL BE CLOTHED IN THE LIGHT AND FED WITH MORNING MEN TILL SUMMERS HEAT MELTON E BASIDE THE FOUNTAINS AND THE SPRING TO FLOURISH IN ETERNAL VEILS THEY WHY SHOULD FELL COMPLAIN
446,WHY SHOULD A MISTRESS OF THE VEILS OF HAR MATURA SIGH
447,SHE CEASED AND SMILED IN TEARS THEN SAT DOWN IN HER SILVER SHRINE
448,WHICH THOU DUST SCAPTURE ON EVERY LITTLE BLADE OF GRASS THAT SPRINGS REVIVED THE MILKED COW AND TEAMS THE FIRE BREATHING STEED
449,BUT THOU IS LIKE A FAINT CLACK UP KINDLED THAT THE RISING SUN I VANISHED FROM MY PEARLY THRONE AND WHO SHALL FIND MY PLACE
450,AND WHY IS SCATTERS ITS BRIGHT EAUTY THROUGH THE HUMAN AIR
451,DESCEND A LITTLE CLOUD AND HOVER BEFORE THE ICE OF FELL
452,OH LITTLE CLOUD THE VIRGINS I CHARGED THEE TO TELL ME WHY THOU COMPLEANEST NOW WHEN IN ONE HOUR THOU FATE AWAY THEN WE SHALL SEEK THEE BUT NOT FIND AH FELL IS LIKE TO THEE
453,I PASS AWAY YET I COMPLAIN AND NO ONE HEAR'S MY VOICE
454,THE CLOUD THEN SHOWED HIS GOLDEN HEAD IN HIS BRIGHT FORM EMERGED
455,AND FEARST THOU BECAUSE I VANISH AND IT SEEN NO MORE
456,IT IS TOO TEN FULL LIFE TO LOVE TO PEACE AND RAPTURES HOLDLY UNSEEMED ASCENDING WAY MY LIGHT WINGS UPON BALMY FLOWERS AND COURT THE FAIR I DO TO KAKE ME TO HER SHINING TENT THE WEEPING VIRGIN TREMBLING NEELS BEFORE THE RISEN SON
457,TILL WE ARISE LINKED AND A POLD IN BAND IT NEVER PART BUT WALK UNITED BEARING FOOD TO ALL OUR TENDER FLOWERS
458,WITH NOT ALONE NOR OF ITSELF FEAR NOT AND I WILL CALL THE WEAK WORM FROM ITS LOWEY BED AND THOU SHALT HEROD'S VOICE
459,COME FORTHWORM AND THE SILENT VALLEY TO THY PENSIVE QUEEN
460,THAT HELPLESS WORM AROSE AND SAT ON THE WELL EASY LEAF AND THE BRIGHT CLOUDS SAY OLD DEFINED HIS PORTNER IN THE VEIL
461,IMAGE OF WEAKNESS ART DOWN BUT A WORM
462,I SEE THEY WAY HELP WAS THE MINKET WEEPING IN NONTEGOTTES NONE TO CHERISH THEE WITH MOTHER'S SMILES
463,AND SAYS THOU MOTHER OF MY CHILDREN I HAVE LOVED THEE AND I HAVE GIVEN THE A CROWN THAT NONE CAN TAKE AWAY
464,AND LAY ME DOWN IN THY COLD BED AN BELIEF MY SHINING LOT
465,OR AN I HAVE GIFTS AND GRACES SHOWERING FRUITS AND COINTED GOLD
466,WHY A TONGUE IMPRESSED WITH HONEY FROM EVERY WIND
467,WHY AN EAR A WHIRLPOOL FIERCE TO DRAW CREATIONS KIN
468,HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STOOP FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LATELED OUT IN TOIC PEPPER FLOUR FATTEN'S SAUCE
469,STUFF IT INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNSELLED HIM
470,AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BROFFLES
471,ET ARRITY ANY GOOD IN YOUR MIND
472,NUMBER TEN FRESH AND ELLY IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HUSBAND
473,THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS
474,THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHERE ON ANOTHER REQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD A BROAD ITS WIDENING TALE
475,A COLD LUCID INDIFFERENCE ARE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
476,THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
477,AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
478,WELL NOW IN A SIGH DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
479,ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SO DALITY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
480,HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLDINESS A STRANGE LIGHT BLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
481,IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HEARD NIGHT
482,HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE
483,BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOL ROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
484,THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATECH IS A DEADLESS
485,STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HARRIN CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
486,IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ERID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING OFF TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
487,THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLE AND PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROPE IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
488,IF A MAN HAD STOLED ON A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO A MASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOWEN ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST OF CREWING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
489,IF A LAMEN IN GIVING BAPTISM POUR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
490,HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BE ATTITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BE ATTITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
491,WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE UCHARIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
492,IF THE WINE CHANGE INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS CHEESES CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
493,A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND BURGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
494,THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATICISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM
495,HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID
496,THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND HONOUR OF SAINT FRANCES ZAVIOR WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
497,ON FIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS
498,BEWARE OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE
499,STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FAYED WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWER
500,HE IS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE OF POSTLE OF THE INDIES
501,A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCES SAVIOUR
502,THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASPED THE HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
503,HE HAD THE FACE IN HIM THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS
504,A GREAT THING SAINT FRANCIS IZAVIER
505,IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TARNY GLOW
506,HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
507,FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAKING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
508,HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BOWL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM MAC AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRIC AND WAS SAFE
509,THE UNIVERSITY
510,PRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES
511,WHO WAS FEET TO AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS
512,THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED
513,SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
514,THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TOO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
515,ANDREW WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A RAFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK CATS AND HUMBLE TAPELIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKY
516,BROTHER MICARDLE BROTHER HE OFF
517,THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION
518,IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
519,IDLENEN MBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE SERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
520,THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN A CHORD
521,WORDS WAS IT THEIR COLORS
522,THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NO MADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING A HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
523,THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRON SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALIED AND WOULD BEGIRT AND CITADEL AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES
524,AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN
525,A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING
526,HELLO STEPHENALS HERE COMES THE DEADLISS
527,THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HUND STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSE PLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WETH LUSTRE
528,HE STOOD STILL INDEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS
529,IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESSANCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
530,STEP FOR ALL STEADILES
531,A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HASTE RAPPED CITY
532,YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITIAN HOMEBIND TURNER AND TON'T COUT IT IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
533,THE UNITED EVERY QUALITY IN SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND NO REFERRENT TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS CURE SCURISTS
534,BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CURATE SCURROUS DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING ON SEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION DETAIN IN A BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
535,MY FIRST IN PRINCIPAL REASON WAS AT INFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LANG TORTONS OF DISTINCT HUGH SIDE BY SIGN
536,SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN NIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMAN MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HEART AT EDGE
537,DOES THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOUR IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CREPOTHES ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
538,THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAK OF AN
539,THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH HIS LEFT FOR THE MOST TART ONE TOUCH A BLACK AS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY TO FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE JROWSY INNER EDGE OF THE MANDABLE
540,FOR BELIEVE ME THE FUNNA FLOSPIFY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE READ AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL VART IS AN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
541,NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HEES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND TURTLY IN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEIR CREDATED JUSTLY
542,BUT NISPING YAND COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
543,THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT UNLOW SUBDUED TONS THEIR FAVOURITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GREAT PAPER
544,IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLOURLESS WE USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLLAR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LITLE THE VIRTUES IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
545,IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE UTTER
546,DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOLS AND EASY ONE
547,THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOLS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MISTER FAMENESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
548,THIS AT ONCE COMPOSED YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECRATIVE THAT A REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL FAINCE IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOUR PRODUCING JEWELLERS WORK RATHER THAN TICTURES
549,THAT A STYLES WERE STRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO IRRUNIUS
550,IN ALL OR LE GATHERGART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION IN RAGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSICARD
551,THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERER HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
552,BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIDE NOSSI TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
553,IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FROM NOBLE PIERCE PAINTING I MUST YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FHILISTY AND PIECE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
554,YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
555,THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARACY WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIVER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLYMY AND YET SPRING AND CLOSE DOWN CLIED LIKE A POOL BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
556,NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART IN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MOURN MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE IN GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
557,YOU KNOW I'VE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL MATERIALISM IN CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST AND CLOUD AND FIRE
558,HERE'S AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLD MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES WERE TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHAT SOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO IN THE PIETHAN
559,NOW HERE'S ROFFIEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEIF WHOLLY FORMAL THE BEAUTIFUL MIST COME INGRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
560,WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TERMS GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND IN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FAR
561,ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD AND FAR
562,HE KNOWS THEM BUT
563,THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER SHAD DUDLEY AND THE FLENT
564,IT IS ONLY IT PENCE OUTLINED BY EDWARD BURN JONES AN ILLUSTRATION IN THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
565,EVERY PLAN IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROSS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
566,EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNVERSAL WITH THE TERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AN EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRISTEL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHOSER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
567,THUS IN CHASSER'S DREAM
568,IN BOST THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IT STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
569,EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WERE SEEMINGLY NEGLEGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ACCIINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF WHOLE BINE OR DUR
570,BUT NOW HERE'S A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURN ADDREW AT ALL
571,AS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
572,THE CRAMPNESS IN THE POVERTY OR ALL INTENDED
573,IT IS A GLEANER BRAIN DOWN HER ONE SHIEF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN
574,THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
575,SEE THAT YOUR LIES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOYS CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE
576,IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU DO YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEY THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WAR WOLF IN THE GUEREAGLE
577,HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THROUGH ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
578,GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN
579,YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRINT LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
580,THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH BOULTLESS BEAUTY IT'S A TIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
581,THIS OUTWARD NEW DABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER IN HER LIFE
582,PESTY COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VACALLY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENT DISPERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS ABIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAYENG FROM ITS MATERIAL OF BIRTH
583,THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PERLITHIC OF THE STORM AND WHERE A WENT
584,HESTER PRINT NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
585,MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
586,AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PERAL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT ROLLED THE MOMENT
587,IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET IT EXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HUP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WITH THEIR PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
588,BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELTH IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS SPLESSION BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
589,BURDING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS A BOKED THE SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
590,PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INTENTILE WORLD
591,PEARL SAW AND GAZED AND TENTLY BUT NEVER STOPPED TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
592,IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
593,HESTER PRIN WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLING HAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FERNAGED AND EMBORIDED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE BORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THE SPORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONORABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY
594,ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBOIDERED GLOVES AND PELTESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND DACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
595,AT THAT EPOCH OF PURSETEN SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS HAVE EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF BAR LESS IN TWINSIC WAIT THAN THE WELFARE A PESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH A DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
596,THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSE A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN THAN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
597,WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARLS RICH AND LUXURIATE BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
598,IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
599,THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSOON DIDS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SAMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORE BIT INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
600,BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
601,COME THEREFORE AND LET US SPLING MUD AT THEM
602,BUT PERLL WHO WAS A DAUGHTE WAS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAPPING HER FOOT BEEN SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
603,SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
604,IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES ON DIAGRANDS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DORABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
605,THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLEGGED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATISH WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUDDERS TO CLOSE OVER THAT THAT NEED
606,LIFTING THE IRON HABIT THAT HONG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRIN GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY BONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BONDSERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISH MEN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEAR'S SLAVE
607,YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE ALLEACH
608,YOU MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
609,WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND THE DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLING HIM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIR ESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
610,ON THE TABLE AND TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PUTER TANKERED AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTH Y RENNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE
611,LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONT OF PIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE
612,MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HEAR LOOK NOOK
613,AND TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
614,FURL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOAT WINDOW AT THE FARTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAPEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT TROUBERY
615,BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALBARY TO HAVE READ LINGUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
616,THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PININCILLA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL
617,FEARLE SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRIE WHERE OUR BED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
618,HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLOOMY PANTS WITH GOLD BUFFALS A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BREATHED WITH GOLD
619,HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN IN A FLAD BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TIMY THE GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
620,INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURN OVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE CODE HAD WIDE CUST OF GOLD BRAID
621,FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF EWES IN WHICH THEY LIVED
622,WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNSIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
623,NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
624,AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THE SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCH KINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLICANS THE PATH DIVIDED
625,HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
626,ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED OUT THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND A NEW NUNK IN OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
627,THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPPED
628,ON CANNOT CAT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL AND BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
629,I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY OWN
630,WE HAVE COME FROM A FIRELONELY REPLACE THAN THIS ALTHOUGH MERE PLACE
631,AND YOU MUST BE ODO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
632,ODO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL AND ALL HIS LIFE
633,WE'RE TAVELING REPLIED O JOE AND WE STATHED YOUR HOUSE JUST A RESTING OF FRESH OURSELVES
634,THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
635,AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
636,IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FROM MY GOOD WIFE MARGALOT WHO ONCE TO USE SOME THE BIT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
637,YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGALADE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WIDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOBBY THE WITCH WHO USED TO LEAVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIQUENS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
638,THE FIRST LOT WE TEPT TO DON OUR GLASS HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
639,I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAP AND MADITION MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
640,I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH YOU ABOUT THE LAND AND USE
641,USE IDLY AT DOLL MY LIFE WITHOUT NUNKEY THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO COUNT ME ANYTHING
642,THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE ODO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN SYMPATHETIC TONE
643,I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORE GIRL SAID MARGALATE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
644,BUT FIRST ABLE TELL YOU THAT FROM MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH A HOUSE WORK AND TO COCONEILS AND WATCH THE DISHES
645,YET THAT TASK WAS NOW AS OLEASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
646,A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ALL MEATLY SO TOGETHER
647,SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLOURS OR SO NAKE STOP
648,WHEN I FOUND DID I SAID TO MYSELF THAT HE WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIE IF SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS HAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TIME TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCH GINS ARE
649,AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OWSENMILIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLORR
650,I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
651,OH JULL EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
652,LARGALOT HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORE QUILLED AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCH WORK SKIRT AND IN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING A SAME GAME MATERIAL THROUGHOUT
653,THE HEAD OF THE PATCHORE GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
654,THE HAIR WAS OF BROWNIARD AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEED BRAIDS
655,GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF OWES AND IS USED FROM ANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT HAS SOFT IMPLIABLE
656,NO I FORGOT ON ABOUT TO BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
657,WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGALAC BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT IN HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
658,SHE POURED INTO THE DITHICANITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
659,I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
660,SHE RAN YOU WERE HUSBAND SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR CATTLES FROM THE FIRE
661,THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
662,VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALTOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED AT WITH A GOLDEN SCHOON
663,NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
664,ODO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO THEY COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAN ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
665,HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SNALL HOLES
666,MOST PEOPLE TALKED TOO MUCH SO IT IS I RELIEVED TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
667,I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
668,THE WISIT OF EYES WHO USED TO BE A HUMBAG AND KNEW NO MATTIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND UNTOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT STORCEROUS
669,IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
670,I NOW USE THEM AS ORDINANT TILL SATUARY IN MY GARDEN
671,DO ME WHAT A CHATTER BOX ARE GETTING TO BE UNK REBARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
672,ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
673,THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE NEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
674,THE EDICT OF MALAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
675,BUT THESE INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR AMBIBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SEX WHICH DESCENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND DOPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
676,CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE VERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
677,SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE UTICS OF DIE ACCLETION AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WITH APPLOTTED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO WOULD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
678,THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE OPPOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF THE EUROPE AND ASHA WERE INFECTED BY THE CANTAGING OF GUILT CONSCIISM AND THAT THE PAROGATIVES OF THE CALFIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED IN VIOLET THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
679,VISHIP'S VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE CONMUNION OF THE DOMITISTS
680,PROSCRIBED BRETHE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DOMINIST STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN DOMIDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
681,SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TAIL THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH IN THRIMING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGES EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES
682,THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELLERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
683,AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWK I WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATES AND WATCHFUL
684,HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
685,DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGUTCH COOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
686,YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SKIRROONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
687,LET ITS RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEEN OR EYES
688,JING YUTH COOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
689,THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
690,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
691,SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
692,IF A ROCK OR RIVULET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERAL THE LINKS OF THE CLUE THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
693,EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE AWFULS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES
694,A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT FOR HIS PORTION
695,THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
696,THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WERE EM CUS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOIST ILLUVION
697,RUN BACK UNCAS AND BRAINLY THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT
698,NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HAWK EYE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
699,IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE AND PRACTISED INTELLECTS OR INTENTILY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
700,AND OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF VALIMS ASKED TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SCAPTACLE ON THE SUBJECT OF A BEAR SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
701,THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS HEIR AND THE MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
702,THE INGENIOUS HAWK I WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
703,THE BARE SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
704,CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS A TRUCE BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
705,COME COME RETURNED HAWK EYE ON CASING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
706,THE YOUNG MAN IS IMBONDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED
707,I GREATLY MOURNED THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HIM CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
708,THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAN MITIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
709,THE LODGE IN WHICH ANCUS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
710,FOUR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS SWARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
711,DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF A SENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE AND WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS AND AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
712,THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTIONED TO THE SUPPOSED CONJUROR TO ENTER
713,BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAINED THE SEATED HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
714,THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BELOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TO CONTINUE DAVID IMPROVING THE HAND HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
715,THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
716,IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COOKERY
717,ANNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITHS
718,THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED I THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
719,WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGLES AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THIS SINGER IS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
720,THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIPPED THE DEER
721,UNCAS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR AND READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
722,BUT HAWK EYE WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF INTO HIS COMPANION
723,SO UNCUS YET BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
724,WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE AND WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
725,AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCALE TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
726,MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST AS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY IN LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLE THAT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOT IN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITS
727,IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD HE WERE BEING AN UNCOMPOSSOR WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
728,SUCHEOES FOR YOURSELF TO MAKE A RUSH ORTARY HERE
729,BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY AS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE
730,KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK HOU SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
731,IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST IN BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOMES TRUE AURIERS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS
732,HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THAT WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AN UNWORTHY AND HUMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NOT THE DAMNABLE PRINCIPLE OF REVENGE
733,THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH TO PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW AND PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT ACROSS A BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
734,GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SENT HAS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ATTERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS IN THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
735,THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD IN PERIONING THROUGH THE DIM LIKE TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
736,WILL THE HERONS HERE HIS GROANS
737,THOUGH HE CAN START IT ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK A SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFITTED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
738,HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
739,LUNCAS CAST AS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
740,I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
741,I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROL VILLAGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
742,MY FRIENDS TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
743,WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN INCOMFORTABLE MAN
744,I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
745,I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
746,THE ONLY DUPLICT IT WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
747,THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
748,THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
749,THEY'LL TURN IT WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
750,I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WILL I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
751,A BROKEN TIP OF LED WAS LYING THERE ALSO
752,NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOLL WERE CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SOUGHT US IN IT
753,ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
754,TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
755,DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
756,I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
757,SOME IT SEEMS TO ME
758,NOW MISTER SULMS AT YOUR SPOSAL
759,ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
760,THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIP TOE WITH HIS NECK CRANE HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
761,THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAIN SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE
762,BY AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
763,ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
764,YOU LEFT HIM A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
765,THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
766,AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOMMS FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
767,HOW LONG WITH A TAKEN TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
768,THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEES THE NEXT
769,HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THET
770,MISTER SALMONS WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
771,HOMES HELD OUT A SMALL SHIP WITH THE LETTERS AND AND IN THE SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
772,WHATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AND INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
773,I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER I WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISH'S SURFACE NOW I SEE NOTHING
774,AS HOMES TRY THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE REGIDITY AND IN LEARNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
775,HOME TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HULLA WHAT IS THIS
776,HOME SHAD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN FALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
777,WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
778,I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENT TO USE THE STAIR AND ARE THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
779,AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YES
780,ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
781,LET US FOR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
782,MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
783,THE TAP FLOOR BELONGS TO MAUSE ME CLARIN
784,I DO NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
785,HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THE SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET RETINE OF HIS LIFE
786,BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE STAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
787,DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE

792,OH I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SIR
793,YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR
794,IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILLOW AD APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND
795,HE WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
796,THE SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
797,NO NAME'S PLEASE SAID HOMES AS WE KNOCKED A GILCHRIST DOOR
798,OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RUTHER SUSPICIOUS
799,THAT IS VERY IMPORTANCE AND HOMES
800,YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THA POSITION
801,TO MORROW WAS THE EXAMINATION
802,I CAN'T ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
803,IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
804,I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOOD BY
805,WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
806,THE FOUL MOUSE FELLOW AT THE TOP
807,HE IS THE ONE WITH THE WORST RECORD
808,WHY BANISTER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAME IN THE MATTER
809,HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING BUT PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
810,MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
811,NO GOOD MY DEAR WASSON
812,I THINK SO YOU HAVE FORMED A CONCLUSION
813,YES MY DEAR WATSON I HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY
814,LOOK AT THAT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
815,ON THE PALM WERE STREETS OF APPYRAMIDS OF BLACK DOUGHEY CLAY
816,AND ONE MORE THIS MORNING
817,IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLISHIP
818,HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THINK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
819,YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
820,IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARSHALL
821,NOSE SIR CERTAINLY NOT
822,THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
823,HIS TROUBLED BOUEEYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER

835,NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
836,A STUDDENT IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PROOFS
837,HE PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE
838,GLOVES SAID THE YOUNG MAN
839,SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE
840,HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MISTER DILCHRESS
841,I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISTER SUMMS WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT
842,IT WOULD BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
843,IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW
844,IF MISTER SOLEM SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP
845,IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SINGER SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE SO THE FRIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
846,THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT AF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS
847,JOHN TAILOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER FEW COLLEGE WAS HINTERED IID IN COTTON
848,BETTER GO HE HAD COUSILS ENTENTIOUSLY

858,SO FOR THE HUNDRED TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE OF THE LAYING BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS
859,COTTON SHE BARSED
860,SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITH INTOUCH IN SIGHT
861,THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER SEARCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
862,AM I BE A BIT OF POOR TREE HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF HIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
863,HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STOCKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AS SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY

871,NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTON
872,THE HONOURABLE CHARLES SMAN FOMISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UP TOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
873,AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPARENCES AND ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SINATE
874,WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN
875,SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS
876,AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND IS QUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO NIGHT THEIR WORK SHE JECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRIED IN THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRIED AND MISTER AND MISSUS BANDERPOLE MISTER HARRY CREST WELL IN HIS SISTER JOHN TAILOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLESMIT WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE YOU DINAH INTEREST EARLIER IN THE DAY
877,MISSUS GREY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MINE VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH
878,SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESTWILL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY IS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
879,DO BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARY TAYLOR
880,HABILEE IN THE TRAIN ON OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HASK A PASSITY TO THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTEDLY SECONDED HIM
881,BUT CRESTWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITATED DIFFICUS IN NO MOSLAY BETWEEN RACES
882,THE VANDARPOOLS WERE SURE THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GRAY WAS MYSTIFY BUT HARDLY DARED ADMITTED THE GENERAL TRINE OF THE CONVERSATIONS SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPER SCRUTINY BEFORE BEAN ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM

884,BUT WE ANNOTTE EXACTLY WILCOME
885,MARY TALLOW HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZORA TO MISSUS GRAY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
886,FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER DAVANTAGEFUL NORA BENNOWS AND SOUTHERNERS ALL RIVING OUT A BAND OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
887,HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEETS IS ABSAR AS MUST BE RUINED
888,IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT ROUND IT
889,AY SWANT THE COOL SWAN
890,THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIKE AND SLOWLY TO LIT FLAME LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN VURNING WONDER
891,HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO NOON OR NEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT
892,SHE WAS SO STRANGE IN WHOMORE A CREATURE
893,THE WORLD WAS WATER VEILED AND MISS
894,THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BROTHER OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE LOSE DEAL THE EARTH STEAM
895,WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING
896,THE LAGOO HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH A DIETS A WEEK AGO AND NOW
897,PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING
898,HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
899,HE S BLASHED TO STAMP ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
900,THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRIVE
901,HE STOOD A MOMENT BE WILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT TO PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF ALL OF GREEN THI ALL WET AND WILLOWWAY
902,THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP ADGE TEVBY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BULLS
903,FOR ONE LONG MOMENT PAUSED STUPID A GATE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THENLY DIZZILY AGAINST THE TREE
904,HE GAZED DE BELL RELEXED AS DONISHED
905,HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH HINTS AND AT WORK AND PAIN SOME ONE HAD DUGGED CAN NOW FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORM WERE HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND POOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
906,HE SAT DOWN WEAK THE WILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPROMOST SORE
907,THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN
908,THE HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
909,UP IN THE SICK ROOMS OR A LAY ON THE LITTLE WIDE BED
910,THE NET AND WELL OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROLL FOR HER LIFE WAS GNAWLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES IN QUESTION
911,FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR AND HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE ITS SUN AND BIRD AND TREE
912,SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TRIMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
913,SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITH IS BOARDS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROAN AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
914,ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LOW THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
915,THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
916,HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND CAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
917,IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PEAL POWDERY LIKEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO HAS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY CONTAINIONSHIP WITH THE LINE STONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES WHOPEN DOSE AND THE DOOR PLACE
918,THE BINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PAINS AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
919,FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONROUS BAYING BEHIND THE LIVERIED BLACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PEAR
920,A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT IN A BARRER BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SIMEMPTY CORN BAGS
921,AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HEAN WINDOW
922,SEVERAL CLOSED HORSES APPLIION A SPINNING WHEEL IN AN OLD BOX WHITE OPENED AND STUFFED BULL OF COLORED RAGS
923,AND THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN ALL WHICH SO PARIS MUTILATION IS CONCERN THERE IS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE IN ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
924,THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAYING NOW
925,BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER REIGN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS AND THE RED TILES OF THE COWCHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THOSE HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BUILD THATS WHO ARE SEIZING THE APPROTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BRODDY IN IT THIS POSSIBLE
926,WERE THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WIDOW OTHER WIFE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH A LATEST TREADLESTON GASSIP
927,HEATY SORROW OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AND THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ARNAMENT AND FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PUTREDISHES THERE WERE ARRANGED ON THE SHOWLS ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DID OUR TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GREAT WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
928,DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH AND HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EAT IN THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIKE FOOTED
929,THE VAMELING LIKE THIS BETWEEN HER IN HER KNEES DINAHMORIS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAUS SURRAFIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA IN MERRY
930,HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAME SOUL CAME WITH EIGHT SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LUCTURE IS A BARREL ORGAN TAKE SUPPATUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
931,THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WITOWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY EITHER HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
932,TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLIE HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER GINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANS YOURSELF WITH GREAT DESPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUMMISSIBLY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILLING TIME
933,SPINTING INDEED
934,I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR GALLOWSNESS
935,WHO TAUGHT YOU DESCRIBE A FLOOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
936,COME THE WOLL FOR THE WIDOW'S INDEED

943,SHE'S GOING TO WITH THE IRONING THINGS AWAY
944,MONEY I DID LIE TO DO INTO THE BARN TO TOM ME TO SEE THE WIDOW
945,NO NO NO TODDY AT DIGHTER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CURRYING AWAY HER IRON
946,DID EVER ANYBODY SEE A LIKE SCREAMED TO MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER I HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
947,TOTDY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NEEP OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK PLICK THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
948,AND SHE WAS VERY FOUND OF YOU TWO AND RACHEL
949,I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU AND THE SAME SORT OF WAY
950,WHICH HE HAD THAT BAN ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I AM TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
951,AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS A SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING IN TELLINGS ISN'T MADE UP
952,BUT NOT MORE THAN WHAT IN THE BIBLE AND SAID DINAH
953,NAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK IN THEIR FAMILIES
954,WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT HIS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE PITS US FOR IT AND COULSUS TO IT
955,I COULD NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE AND TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
956,I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE IN THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I HAVE DONE
957,I DIDN'T PREACH WITHOUT DIRECTION
958,DIRECTION
959,I AM A COMMONPATIENCE WITH YOU
960,ARE THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES HE WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN
961,SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
962,O SERDO MENTIONED SAID MISSUS VOICER
963,I DELIGHTING YOUR KITCHEN
964,POYSERS NOT ATTOLE MISSEY
965,SAID KEPT AND DANNY THORN SETTING HIMSELF WERE GOOD SEA ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DARRY DOOR
966,NEW SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TEROSSADOR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOLL
967,BUT THERE'S FATHER AND BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE
968,NO THING YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WELP SAID LE THE MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
969,I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
970,FOR IF IT IS ANYWHERE ON THE FAR WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
971,OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER AN ARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
972,BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN IDEA SIR
973,I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A POICE
974,I KNOWS FARM ISN'T BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITH INTEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BE IT
975,BY THE BYE I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY IT MUST SEE YOUR DEARY MISSUS POYSER
976,THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE MOLK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
977,OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S AN CAPITAL ORDER
978,THE PARIS PLANNED LIKE THAT AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
979,THE LONDON PLANT WAS LUSH EMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAPSED IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF WHOLE BORN VIADA
980,THERE MASSEYERS JUNSTED AND HAMMER HAD PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDERED IN THE YARD AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN BE YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
981,THE DINAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBOSHED FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VESSISTITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
982,FOWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRUSSIER DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IT DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAVE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ALECTRICAL ENERGY OF THE CONSUMERS ADDIZON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
983,WHY IF WE ERECTOR STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
984,THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
985,BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS PEDIOST IN CRIDICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
986,EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED THAT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
987,FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
988,IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTRIC PLAITING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD AT CHARGE STORIC BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECTORRARET
989,BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURE A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARMHOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRANTS IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
990,EDICION WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHOTDY AND NOTHING WOULD SOTTISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MIKERISCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALBON OMETER
991,UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED IN REGULATED THAN THOSE EVADABLE FOR HIS DINAH HO AND LAP ADDISHEN REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
992,MISTER ADDISTANT WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
993,HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOADED WITH A FRICH OF BREAK ALSO REGULATER OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
994,THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBERCATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER RADICTON INFORMED ME THAT AS OF RAIN ANGEN STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT THE YORK UNCONTINUED ROTTING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AT ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSE IS MUSPRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
995,ADDISTION HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM AN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARCH SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST THE STRAIGHT TOO WIRE SYSTEM THREW OUT OF THE TREE KIND
996,HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR A LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT DOVE LARGE CITIES
997,THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE GATIS AND SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THERE WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS IT ORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND HAD GAVE AN IMMEDIATE EMPHASIS TO INCONDUCE AND LIGHTING
998,IT WAS SPECULATELY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDER SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
999,THE THREE CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLLINE CONSTRUCTION ADD WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY ADDISTANT TO BUILD AND EQUIPPE CENTRAL STATIONS
1000,MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE OR SYSTEM KNOWN OF ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINS AND MISTER EDICINE BEING INDEPENDENT AND BENTERS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
1001,I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDITON CONSTRUCTIONED DEPORT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED AHEA
1002,BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
1003,THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVED MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF ADASTONIA BUT THEY REMAINED IMPRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS ONE INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
1004,THE ARC LAMP AND STALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PROMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOUR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MADY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBADE FOUR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP LIKE BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
1005,EVIDENT HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
1006,THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICES AND AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER IN VETERS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT BARRETHAL THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ALL ACTURESTIVE THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WADE AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINTED USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
1007,HENCE THE ADDISTION ELECTRILITIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS ACTUAL AND QUALITIES
1008,THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE ADDISTANT ELECTRILITIC METER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DEEP IMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
1009,ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY ADD THE IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT FEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
1010,THE STANDARD ADDISTANT METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY POR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SAT BEING SUBSTITUTED
1011,IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTIETH MISTER DOUBLEY J J J J J RED AND INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINE AIRS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
1012,THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULT ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDENT BASIS
1013,IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF ADDITION ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTION UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE ADDISHINE METER WAS ACCURED AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FANATURAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED AND A STATION SHALLING CURRENT BY METER
1014,THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY MIND AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CUNTURY
1015,HE WEIGHED AT REWAY THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN BAME
1016,HE THOUGHT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS IN OTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUDDEN BETTER
1017,THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED
1018,WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAT IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
1019,WE HAD METERS IN WHICH THEY WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
1020,WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISHED SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
1021,THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM LIGHT HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN ARE OUTSIDE THE LITTERIN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER AND LESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
1022,LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY UNGLALATIONS
1023,THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME A PRESSIVE
1024,IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
1025,DEWORK HAD TO BE CONVENCED
1026,A WORD SHID NOW BE SET ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMONTHROA AND OLLATIONS
1027,MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GULLATIONS FOR INSTANCE
1028,IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK ON THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO ISSUETS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANY SCRIPT FOR THE FRINTER
1029,IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CETUAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE CENTER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST MERITS ALONE
1030,WHAT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE
1031,THE LORD WAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOOP TOO
1032,THEN WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAY AND FOREVER
1033,IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SEEING PAUL
1034,THEY SAID TO THE GLACIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
1035,HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CHRIST
1036,DEPALKHIM LATER AND HIS BENEATH US
1037,INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
1038,DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW MOUTH RINHERITICS WOULD THIS SOME ON HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
1039,AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES HOLE BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APPASTOLIC AUTHORITY A MINISTRY
1040,AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR ITS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXOLVE HIS OFFICE IN ORDER THE GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
1041,PALTAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRESE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
1042,PULL AND APOSSIL NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
1043,YET HE CALLS MINISTERS TO THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CAUSED THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND POSSELS
1044,PAUD THE CLEARS OF THE FALSE POSSILS WERE CALLED ARE SENT NEITHER BY MEN MORE BY MAN
1045,THE MOST THEY COULD QUIET HIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
1046,HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECT THAT BY GOD
1047,THERE CALL WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
1048,FOR A PERSON OF POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
1049,IS SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
1050,AND I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT HALL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
1051,I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
1052,I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE YOU RETAUSED SELF A STREAMS TEA A CERTAIN STEED A CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRIT A BOASTING
1053,THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE
1054,AND GOT THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
1055,THE CLOSTING SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
1056,THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RICHESTNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SUN AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
1057,IN THIS WHOLE PISTOL PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
1058,BY HIS RESURRECTION CRIST ONE THE VICTORY OVER MAW SIN FLESH MOIRL DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
1059,FIRST TOMB
1060,AND ALL THE BRETHRE ON WHICH ARE WITH ME
1061,THAT SHE GO FAR AND SHUTTING THE MOUSE OF THE FALSE APOSSIPS
1062,ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH FOR YOUR NOT A POSSILS LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT IN TEACH AS I DO
1063,THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINY THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
1064,WARD THEN OUT IMADE THE CATHOLIC PROMINENCES IMPREACHED THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODMISS PRINCES THE SHIPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
1065,WE LOOKED FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR A EAR HEARD NEITHER HALF ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
1066,NOT ALL THE CULATIONS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
1067,THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTEMNINATE
1068,THEY REMAINED TO FIND REGARDLESS OF MEN OF INHIM
1069,WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICROSS TREAMS THERE
1070,SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE APPISTLE NOT FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APPOSSIBLE VERSE THREE
1071,GRACE BE TOO YOU IN PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR MORE JESUS CHRIST
1072,THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PIECE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
1073,THE GRITTING OF THE APOSTLES REFRESHEN
1074,GRACE INVALS THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
1075,THE WORLD BRAINS THIS A PERIIIIIOUS DOCTRINE
1076,EXPERIENCE PROOTSLESS
1077,HOWEVER THE GRACE IN PIECE OF GOD WILL
1078,MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
1079,WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
1080,TO DO SO AS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WE SEEK TO MEASURE INTO COMPREHEND DISIMPENDENT MAJESTY
1081,HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES ME FASTEN UPON HIM
1082,EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NEATURE OF GOD
1083,DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY IN THE TRUTH IN THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH NT TO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
1084,WHEN YOU ARE YOU ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
1085,WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST TO HAS BEEN APPROACHED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
1086,AT THE SAME TIME ALL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
1087,THAT CHRIST'S VERY GOD IS APPARENTING THAT PALLASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO ST SPENNSE GRACE AND PEACE
1088,TO BESTOW PEACE IN GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CONCREATED HIS BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
1089,OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD A FRIEND GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM A LORD JESUS CHRIST
1090,THE ARIANS TOOK CRIES FOR A NOBLE IN PERFECT REACHER'S SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
1091,MOHAMMED ALSO SPEECHLY OF CHRIST
1092,HALSTIX TO HIS THEME
1093,HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS APPESTLE
1094,NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASSIAL LAMBS WERE AN ENGIL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
1095,NOT FOR A CROWN WERE A KINGDOM WERE ARE GOODNESS BEFORE SINS
1096,UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
1097,HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINCE
1098,PALLIANCERS THE MAN WHO IS NAME JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR SINCE
1099,SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IS STANCED REASON THAT THEY COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY BY HER OWN EFFORTS
1100,THE SENTENCE ALSO TO FINDS ARE SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
1101,THE GREATNESS OF THE RANDOM CHRIST THE SUN A GOD INDICATES THIS
1102,THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SCENE IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FUR SINCE
1103,BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
1104,WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK REMERIT WE CAN DISMISS IN
1105,THIS PASSAGE THEN THERE IS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MAN OR SOLEMN DER SIN
1106,THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THE SIN AS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES INTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINCE
1107,THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
1108,BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE IN COMFORT AT THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
1109,ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM IS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
1110,HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PRESSNESS THAT IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS THE PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASCHAROMMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES A RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND THE OCCUET FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF TOO MATRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUPS OF SENSE
1111,THE INFLUENCE WHICH THOUGHT TO ME IS HIS EXRESIZE THE PONPOSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISSNER STANDING
1112,IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOCU THE NEW PLATENISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNEXIONS WITH THE JEWISHED AND PHRISTIANS KITCHERS AND OUT OF THEM THEY ENLISTED A DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THIS PIRATE OF PLATO
1113,THEY IMWERE ABSORBED IN THIS THEOLOGY AND WERE OTHER DID THE MINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WAS TRULY GRATE AND TRULY CORRECTURIS IN HIM IS ETHFORT REALIZED IN CONNECT OF STRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
1114,THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMONTATROUS UNDER TOMEUS FALLING UNTID TO BUSURITIES OF THE NEW PLATNESS
1115,IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL ARE WEAR THAT AN INCIENT THE LOSS OF HER ISTOBINETRIPERTED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HIS SHREET OF THOUGHT
1116,THE FANCIES OF THE NEW PLATNESS ARE ONLY INJUSTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXCITE A FHAES OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PROVEIL WHITE WEAPENED THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN EUROPE AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN VE
1117,BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ENGIBRETATION OF PLATIA AND IN SPIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
1118,WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATEAU WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS UNDIALOOK OR WHETHER TO THOUGHT OF A RANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO CRILITIES WHICH SHE HAVE EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS SMINE
1119,THE DIAMOND IS FRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH ANY MOL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS THRB THE HEAP ONLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG BE ANIMOS
1120,BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FINE THIS ANTIMMEDIATERY TOY WHICH LIFE SOME WAYER BETWEEN MEDICINE AND METHODITS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS FREAT AND IN PIEETHEET N RINKING FEUTIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
1121,WITH HERACLETUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUCKS BIKE AN EXAGGERATE HE ASSERTED THE PRODURDINANCE OF PINE ALTHOUGH WHAT MITTING IN THE ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING BY THE PIFFIG REENS HE SUPPOSES THE MISTLEY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
1122,MADY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRICO CREDIC PHILASOPHET ARE INCLUDED INTO TOMEUS
1123,IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RENLATION OPP  IDEISTS GOD WERE OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
1124,THE IDEAS ALSO REMAINED BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANY MOST BURGS FICIES
1125,THE STILE AND WHEN UP TO NEAR US DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALECTS
1126,BUT CLAINTO HAS NOT THE SAINT MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN A FEATRESS OR SIMPOSE HIM
1127,NOTHING CAN EXCEED BUTE HE WERE BROOKING ND DUDCHIN IN WHICH THEIS USING WORDS AFTER HIS COUSTEM MANNER
1128,BUT IT THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEENS FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FOR HIM IS COOLLY GIVEN UP
1129,HE COULD RIGHT IN ONE SILE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER THE GREAT LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET WHERE PELOSSOFFHER TO DESCRY PHYSICAL PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
1130,AND HENCE WE FIND THE SING SORT OF CLUMSINESS AND THAT TO MERE SO PLATO WHICH CARDECT RISES THE PHILOSOPH COPOON OF LACRECIOUS
1131,THERE IS A ONT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THEN OCCURRES AND PLAY TOO SPRARLIA RIGHTENS
1132,PLATIAL HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE PERFECT WORK OF OUR
1133,SOLRITIES BEGINS IT TO ME US WITH A SUMMERY OF THE REPUBLIC
1134,AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION IT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
1135,AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURNED TO ME AS CITIZEN OF LAUGHTRESS WORE AT ONCE OF PHILOSOPHER IN A STATESMAN AND DO YOU CRITIOUS WHOM ALL OFFENIENCE NODE TO THESE SINUALLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HER MORPRIDIES WAS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AN EDUCATION TO SHEAR IN ART THIS COURSE
1136,I WILL IF TO NEED AS A PROVES I APROOF
1137,WISN'T THEN SOLPHRTIES TO A TAIL OF SOLERCE WHO BEING A FRIEND OF DROPIUTES MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MONTGRANDFATHER CRITIOUS AND HE TOLD ME
1138,SOME POEMS OF SOLEMN WHO ARE RECITED BY THE BOYS
1139,IN WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POET SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE T REMARK
1140,THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH ETHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
1141,BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED THE WEE OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ECTORS
1142,TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE'S SOLEMN HER THIS STORY
1143,BUT IN EAGE IT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY OATH RAGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES
1144,THE TENEEALITIES WHICH YOU HAVE ME CITY TO OAS OUT OF YOUR OWN AND ALL SOLEMN ARE AMYERDED SHILDERN STORY
1145,FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE A GREAT FLOW ATHING WAS THE GREAT DISTANT BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNTHER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
1146,SOLEMN MARVELLD AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
1147,NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAD YOU LAST SINCE YOU FOUND AT YOURS AND E THOUSAND SINCE HE FOUND IT ARS AS OUR ANNALS REQUARTED
1148,MINUE LAWS EXISTS AMANGUS WHICH I THE COUNTERPART OF YOUR WAS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLD AND TIME
1149,I WILL BRIEF LIT DE SCRIME TO YOU AND IT SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT TRUE REISURE IN THE SECRET RAGISTURES
1150,OBSERVED AGAIN WHAT HERE THE LOCTOOK IN THE PRESTIVE OF WISTON SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN
1151,THE MOST FAIN AS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHREW OF THE ISLAND OVER TWENTIETS
1152,FOR AT A PARROW OFF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE UTTER HELLINGS HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED BEING FADER AND OFFERED A OWN A CORD GAVE LIBERTY TEACH ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
1153,THIS IS THE EXCLAMATION OF THE SHALLOWS WE CHART FOUL IN THAT PART OF THE APPLANTIC OCEAN
1154,BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT A TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE FRESH LAID MEMORY
1155,THEN NOW AT NEE EXSQUINTS YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TO ME US WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHOSE SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WOULD HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTERJUCENT TO YOU AS THE LOST THE FEEDING CITIZENS OF WHOM EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE
1156,THAT ARE READY AT A POINT IN A CONEMIC BAOLUTION FAR ANTATING THE EMOTIONS OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTIONTHICATES AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORROLESCE ELBOBORATE SYSTEM
1157,THE ATTILATIVE CONSEMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERABITIVE GROWTH
1158,SUCH CONSUMPTIONATE FULLS TO THE WOMAN WHOSE MERELY INCIDENT TILL THROUGH THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LAPER AND OFF TO CONSEMPTION DIRECTED TO THE RONE COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
1159,WITH A FURTHER AD FANS AND CULTURE THIS TOBUMAE CHANGE SHE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORAL ESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER I BE A TABIE OR A LARGE TO COMMENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE COMMENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
1160,IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LEXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONGED TO THE LEASURE CLASS
1161,UNDER THE TABOO SETTIN VICTIALS AND MULP DE CLEARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR THUSKS
1162,DRANKINS AND THE OTHER PETHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANCE VERFUL TEND IN THEIR TAN TO BECOME UNARREFIC AS BEING AMOCK AT THE SAKEN REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOUS STATES OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
1163,IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DIZZY'S CONDITIONS OF THE BUDY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVER DAY SPEECH AS A SYNANHM FOR NOBLE ARE GENTLE
1164,THE CONSUMPTION OF LEXURIES AND THE TRUCENTS HIS CONSEMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MOSTER
1165,WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS BEEN MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRICAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RUE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMAN SHOULD CONSEIL ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MOSSERS
1166,THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENCE ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSE OLD PARIFERANALIA IS AN UBD   EXCEPTION TO THIS RUE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTIONIOUS METHOD MORE OBVIOUS AND SUBSTENTIAL
1167,THE CUSTOM OF CEST OF GETHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF COMMABIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MONTTIEVE SORROWS SO PRESENT IN THE LATE TO DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DID NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLD METIVES
1168,THERE IS A MORALIST AND LEBORATE SYSTEM OF RANKING GRATES
1169,THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FERTHED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
1170,MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LIESSURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME NECESSANT OF SUBSTANCE IN THE ROMAN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM US SCARCE NETTLE OTHERS ONLY POSHELY TO BERATE IT AS BY CARASS CONSUMES
1171,SOME MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERSON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLOSED AS I CARRIES CONSUMENT WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
1172,MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER REST OF CRISY OF LESS DEGREE HAVING TURNED ATTOCHED TO THE PERSONS A MORAL LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF I CARES CONSUME IN  A PERSONS OF THEIR WIFES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
1173,THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OF LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DECALLY OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY HAVE BEEN BESIDE TO BE AMACK OF SETITUDE PREILARUS TENSIBLE
1174,THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE RESTED DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SARVITE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
1175,BUT THE GENERAL DISSINCTIONIES NOT A METHOD COUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
1176,SAID THOSE OFF HIS IS WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PREPARE EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE COSSA NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF BOMS AND ACQUITMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHOKE THOSE WHICH MADE A CLOSS AS OUSTENSIBLY PREDITERATE EMPLOYMENTS
1177,QUEEN VER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SEVES IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH A PRIME RELIGIURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIES ARE REFLECTED ON A REFIC CHARACTER
1178,THE LIVERY BECOMES OF NUXIOUS TO NEARLY OLD WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
1179,IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT HOLY IN OL CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS GOING SIGHT
1180,THE DEPUNDENT TO US FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN ELATED EVOPENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NEMBER OF PESSANCE BY HIM THESE DUE DISAWK AS STOMALITY PERFORMED GRADUAL NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LOST
1181,BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIS OF BY CARASS LEISURE AND CONSEMPTION DEVOLVED UPON THE WIFE ALONE
1182,IN A COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTEN COUCHER THIS POINT IS A PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOW EMITTED CLASS
1183,IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS MORALIST FOR TWO TO SECOND STANDS AFTER THEY MUST BITCH BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMENT THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT THED CAN ON THE CLAW OF VOCETED EFFORT
1184,THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO KENDERS SOMETHING OF THIS THEREXSNON INDEED HE COMMON THEY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLIMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALIST SEAS TO CONSEIL VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF A HOUSEHOLDS PECUNIARY DECENCY
1185,VERY MUCH OF SQUALER AND DISCOMFIT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LOST PRETENCE OF THE CUNARY DECENCIES PET AWAY
1186,THERE IS NO PLASS IN NO CONFERENT AS YEILED SO A DECKY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WONT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OUR SPRITUAL NEED
1187,THE QUESTIONIST WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST AFFECTABLY REACH THE PURSENS WHOSE COMBICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT
1188,EACH WILL THERE FOR SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DOING THE EARNER STATES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
1189,THE MUD AN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
1190,IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DARKISTION OF HIGH THING THE ATTILATIVE CONSPECTISUS CONSEMPTION AS COMPARED WITH THE LEASURE
1191,IT IS ALSO NOR TISSIPOLT THAT THE SUB SAID VILLATED CONSEM SHAS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT DOES AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS THAT IT IS BEST IN THOSE POTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH HUMAN CONTECT OF THE INDIVIDUAL HIS WIDEST STANDIN ABILITY OF THE PUPULATION'S GREATEST
1192,COME SUMPTOM BECOMES A LOT TO ENEMENT IN THE CENDRED OF LIVING IN THE CEATADD ON IN THE COUNTRY
1193,AMONG THE COUNTRY PUPELLATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SATINGS AND HOME COME FOOTS KNOWN THROUGH THE NEEDING OF NABONT GUSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SIT THE LIKE GENERAL PEPP IS OF PECUNIARY BEPUTE
1194,THE RESULT IS A GREAT BABILITY OF THE LABOR IMPLOYED IN PRINTING PEAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
1195,UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVETISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPEAK HIS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY IMMELATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
1196,BUT THE ACTUAL COAST OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE STOP AND CAME TOLD THE RANK FERMENT ABOVE WAISTFUL CONSEMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND DOESN'T ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DOING THE QUOST I PEACEFUL COUNTER
1197,OF THE SECOND SENSE PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSE HIS MEANT TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PREDECTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
1198,I RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING WITH QUIETMENTS IS AFFECTED BY RESORT TO MAKE BELIEF MEN AN INTRICATE POLITE OF SEDENCES OF SOCIAL TEATISE OF A CEREMONIOU NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS SUFFHOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIES OBJECT OF A MILIORATION AND BULLED IT IN THEIR OFFICIAL STILENT TYPELE THERE WAS MUCH COMING IN GOING AND A DEAL OF TOKE TO THE EMPTHAT THE TALK IS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
1199,THE SAILANT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SATISFALL RIDID INDIICATED
1200,THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF COMPACH HIS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOOD SORROF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN OLDER TO FICTUALLY MEANT THE CONCEIVEMENT GOOD SAME IT MUST BE EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUTIES
1201,AS USE IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WOOD CARRIES AND UNDER TONE OF DEPRECATION
1202,THE USE OF THE WOOD WASTE AS THE TECHNICAL TURN THEREFUL EMPIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE INSULT BY THE CONCUMER UNDER THIS CANNON OF CONSTANCHIS WASTE

1240,IN THIS MONOTON HIS LIFE A MIND THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
1241,I WAS SHOUVER RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS THE INSTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
1242,MY EYES HOLA TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH ESTATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STAYED I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WONDERING IN THOUGHT INDEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITZ IN THAT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY COW THENISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED ENSURED BY THE VERY SHADOWS THE SPIRITUAL DEATH
1243,IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOT BED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCE THEY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEM OR FOR DIRECTION
1244,AND MEANTIME AND OVER THE GREATNESS OF JEVOLA I KNOWRED THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY FURIES RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIDLY WRONG
1245,THE CRISMAS HOLIDIES CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELED THAT MORE OR LESS
1246,INDEED THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WILL PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
1247,SHE WAS GOING OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERRAND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOTSLIPPED ON ICE AND SHE FELL IT WAS DARK IN NOONS AWA HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ACTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
1248,UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE CANNOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE EX MORNING HAS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT HER HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
1249,HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THAN ARS AND THAT YOUR RESOLVES IS SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT AND MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
1250,AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
1251,I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TWO INTIMATE SOCIETY
1252,A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONTES A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHERE WOMAN WHO KEEPS THE DRUGGIST SHOP AND HALLWORTH AND FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTRIOUS AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDS ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBE'S FRACTURE LEG
1253,TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWALVIERS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
1254,YOUR FUSE AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE HE WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
1255,THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
1256,TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND ANOTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
1257,AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT TO AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
1258,SHE HAD ANOTHER WEIGHT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
1259,BUT ANNE HAD BEGAN TO SOVERGEST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
1260,STUNB BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPRAITED MISS D BUBY FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO AND STATE OF HEALTH
1261,STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ENDS DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAYS SHE WATCHED SO HER HER WITH THE LONGING FON AXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SET AND TANGS OF FEAR
1262,I DOUBT WHETHER BRANWELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
1263,TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH HE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
1264,WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MUMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
1265,IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I'VE SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBEY CONTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
1266,MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PRETERNIZING AIR FOR BY PRONOUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCOVERA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT HAD POUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCURA AND SHE ANDERED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN INQUIRTMENT DAY IN MY LIFE
1267,HER FACE WAS AN ENEKY FORT INSPIRED EVERY ONE WITH THE WARMIST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
1268,SYLVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARIVOLE FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMEDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO PROSTERITY
1269,SYLVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HERSELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARD THE ATTICAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TOWN OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE
1270,TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORMED THE CHARACTER OF MERRY ANNE IN THE COMMODY OF MERRIVO AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
1271,SHE WAS HONORABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SUVERI WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTICHRISTIAN INTOLERANCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
1272,YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSEIL YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SYLVIA DIES
1273,I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
1274,I HAD A NAME I BULLY EVEN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
1275,I SHALL CALL YOU AS SPREE
1276,YOU DONE ME A GREAT HONOUR
1277,HERE GO AND DID ME CHANGE FOR ALLUY I HAVE IT SIR
1278,NATJAH SERBIS SIR
1279,MADAME WHEN SAW BESIDES CANNONSO YORING QUORIES
1280,I SEE IN QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIGHER AT THE RATE OF ONE SOUS MEN READING THE NEWSPEEPER INTO THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BRACKFISTING EITHER A LOW MORE IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO WERE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN AND NARROW STAIRCASE HIDDEN AND THE FOLIAGE
1281,I SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE A WAITER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO INQUIRE MY WISHES
1282,I DOWN TO GIVE ME SO COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD
1283,THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOKED LIKE A FAR ENER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I EVEN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COROR TO THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
1284,I THINK HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVE
1285,I ADDRESSED HIM IN A TOWN IN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITTLY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MEEXED ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
1286,MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVED TO HIM THAT IT DOES NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECTS MAY HAVE BEEN THE LATING WHICH OF THAT INCY DRYDER
1287,I SEE A CROWD IN ONE ORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL OF LOOKING UP
1288,IS THERE NOT A A AAAADY IN EVERYWHERE
1289,YES BUT THE MARIDIAN OF THE PALAIR ROYALE IS THE MOST EXACT
1290,THAT IS TRUE BAD ELT BREE
1291,ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOX HS FILLED
1292,IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE SEVENT CAPT
1293,IS IT BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
1294,BUT TO HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT SO FASHIONABLE
1295,SIMPLY BUT I STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HERS ENOUGH BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX SAID HER SENOUGH WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
1296,YOU ARE NOW IN THE ONLY COUNTRYING THE WORLD WERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELL GO OF INTELLIGENT ENTALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS TRULY A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PEOPLE HERE AND HOWEVER WONDERFUL IT MAY APPEAR SILLINGNESS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WIT
1297,LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP AND LESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED THAT DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
1298,IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH A PROVAL SUCH SHRATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFRECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM AND FALLABLE
1299,WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARROS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT FIVE A LITTLE ROY
1300,SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
1301,WHY T SIR I SAID TO HIM AND MY FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
1302,HE HIMSELF RECITED AT THE SAME PASSAGE AND FRENCH AND POLITE THEY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
1303,BOTH THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
1304,I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT YEARS IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
1305,I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIAL AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULDN'T MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RYNCH ENOUGH TO BAY HIM
1306,IRIE'S EYED IN THE MAPAETHRE ROVED IT TO HIS POT
1307,I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRENCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU RENSATIABLE
1308,HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WITH CELEBRATED FOR HIS WOODY REBARTAISE AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANY ONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
1309,HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE HAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
1310,ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER A SAINT WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
1311,ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNITHI CAN CEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
1312,IN SET OFF BUDSIX REGULARLY A FILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TOO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION LUMBERS TO DAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
1313,IN PLACE OF A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONLEGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF SIGN AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WORDS EACH WARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLIMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRECEDE ORGANIZATIONS
1314,THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS PROSTLE ISSE IITTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING A FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG PORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM THAT WITH ABROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST DECERTING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
1315,NEVERTHELESS OF THE MUSTERED SEED AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HESITATE THEIR PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW IN OAK OFFERING PROTECTIONS AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST POGRAM JOURNING ITS WAY FIRTRUTH
1316,THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SUM LONG BERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSPELITING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THE HEAD QUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THEIR ESTABLISHED
1317,THE BOCOAL MORMON HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTITY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS THEIR EXKINED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH HER EYES WINTED THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
1318,IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE CARELY REGARDED THEIR RELIGION OF A LATTER DE SNANCE WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOCKLE WORMON STRAKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
1319,THE FIRST WELL A SNAVALISH SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF CARLINI OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SNIGHT OF LIKE ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST PEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
1320,TO THE FERDEN LATTER A SNATE A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING AT HOUSE FIRRELIDIS ASSIMILY
1321,SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERSE HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES AND MISERIE INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISERIANS
1322,THE LIEUTENANT COVERER LITTLE BURNT THE BUE BOGS AFTERWARD GOVERNORS WAS A PRONOUNCED THAT MARMINED HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFEST IS SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
1323,THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN SITTLEY CORNICLED BY HUMAN SCRIBE
1324,MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEY SOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CALLED WELL COUNTY THERE IN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
1325,A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON SAMILIES UNSHOUL CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPPIEST SETTLERS AND WHITCHERED A SCORE
1326,BE INSSENT TO THE HONOUR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY ALERT ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY WERE SIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOOD AND PUTCHERY
1327,OH WHAT I RECORD TO READ WHAT HAVE FICTURED THE GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT
1328,AMERICAN SCHOOL BOYS WE WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE HUBBIGENCES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPPLE LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THAT OF DOVE HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEAST AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
1329,WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS HIS DEMORMANTS
1330,AS THE SAMEL OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST OF THE BRUTALITY OF THE MISERIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH TO SIXTEENTH FOTEIGEEN THIRTY NINE
1331,IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANISE MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISERY WITH COVERED HER BOX AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS IN SLIGHTY TOO IT APPEARS I GAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
1332,THE ARMY SOUND THE PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
1333,BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
1334,IT WAS THROUGH FLOODS ADVICED THE BECANE IN OR TO THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIVELY TO INSTANCIBLY TO INSTANCE CHERDAN FENTE OUR REBELLION WHICH HAD FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTRACE OF THIS DOCESSIONISTS
1335,MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHILE GETTER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
1336,ALREADY AND DORTH HAD HISSELF WERE TALKED OF ONE NONSENSE A BOSSUL A WEST
1337,THEY KNEW NO NORTH DO SOUTH THOUGH HE'S NO WESK THEY SAID POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WENT HER NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN AND ARMS FOR THE COUNTRY'S NEED
1338,WHAT THE LETTERY SAINTS CALLS THE LESTRIAL MARRIAGE IN HIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT OF SO ESTILAMARRIAGE PLORALITY WISE WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
1339,WE BELIEVE IN A LITTLE RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FEATURE STATES SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANG TO FIGHT IT AUTHORIZER RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PERITH AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
1340,IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TRADE THE SOIL OF MANY LANCE TROUOBSERVE THE CUSTOMS HAD SUDDEN THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAT ONE KNIGHT YET TO FIND THE PLACE IN ME TO PEOPLE WHEREIN WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MEN AND WOMAN HIS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAT AMONG THE MALIGNED WORMENTS OF THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
1341,AT THE INCEPTION OF BURL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTERAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LOT NATIONAL OR STATE I AGAINST THIS PRACTICE
1342,IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS INNOCTED WITH A PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING PORAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENTER PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS AT DEAD LETTER
1343,FETERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STTTTTTT STATES A TOURNEYS AN UTA WHO WERE NOT MORMENTS NOR LOVERS OF WORMINISM REFUSED TO INTERTAIN TO PLAINTS WERE PROSSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST CINJUSTICE AND INADIQUACY
1344,THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLENGE MISTER MEANER FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXILLENPEDALTY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FROM LIFE I FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE TO BE QUARTERS POWER TO INFORCE INSENTENCES EXTENT SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FINED TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
1345,FOR THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE QUART OF LAST RESORT AND THEIR MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REVUKE IT DESERVED BEN WHERE IMPRISONED UNDERSENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DIRATION
1346,THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT FACES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSTITUTION ALITY OF THE MEASURE
1347,THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY WITH REAL AND PERSONAL CLOLLFICATED AND IS SHE AIDY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNDIED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THAT PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED WE LESSATE OF GREAT VALUE A LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURTS RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS HOME PROPERTY
1348,AND SO THE SORRY OF MORMON IS AND RUNS ON ITS FAVOLITY HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE COURTEON PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN
1349,MAY HOME LIKE ALLEX ENDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
1350,HE HAD PREQUENCELY DIED AS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS ON ECHANCE

1647,SOMETIMES WHO WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SAND Y SHORE SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY ARIDE ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
1648,NO CATHEDRAL THAT EVEN BURGHOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH A CHURCH AT MOUNTARSHA
1649,BENZE OF MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS AND HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSINGLY WERE SERVINT AXE YEARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLEL BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARE UNDISHIMALL OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MOTMARTHA WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
1650,WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVICEDAC
1651,THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BENZA ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
1652,I MIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING IN PSYCHOLOPEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANICDOTES AND TRIPERS TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
1653,FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SERVEDAC HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
1654,IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAN A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S CONVEXITY AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGGING OF THE TOWN MASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
1655,EXCLAIMED SERVIN ACK KEEPING HIS EYE UNMOVED AT HIS TELESCOPE
1656,SHE IS UNDERSTAILED BUT SHE IS COUNTEM A CHAFF'S YAUGHT HE WAS RIGHT
1657,IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE FACTALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS RIVAL
1658,HE RECKONED THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE LAKE ATTASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
1659,THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOBRINE D DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
1660,SERVICEDACK TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THAT HAD BRING A WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
1661,A MARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD ENSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
1662,SLIDELY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAIN SAIL AND IN ORDER TO FASCILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HELMSMAN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOP SAILS BRIGANTIAN AND JIB
1663,CAPTAIN SERVED ACT HASTENED TOWARD HIM
1664,I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOUR A FINDING YOU ON AN ISLAND
1665,NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN AND WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY
1666,NOTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
1667,ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDITERRAMENT
1668,FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPIFIED AND THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELM THE COUNT WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTIONS
1669,TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THE COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
1670,SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS
1671,YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT
1672,MY YADD IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TOUR AROUND THE WORLD
1673,THE COUNT SHOOK HIS HEAD
1674,BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DEBRAINA SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT
1675,IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED
1676,A FLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE ACCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
1677,DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER ARE NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BENSIVE TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
1678,HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WHAT HAD AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE CLOBE
1679,AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF THE TENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE JOT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FARTHER GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
1680,THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MENIFASTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESSO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
1681,STEAM UP AND CANVAS SPREAD THE SCHOONER STARTED EASTWARDS
1682,ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARTICLE SO BUY INTTTHTTTHT THE MERE EFFECT OF OSSILATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THERE WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
1683,FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST ABOUT JERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
1684,THE LOG HAD ACCOMPASSED THEREFORE WHERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXTANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
1685,THERE'S NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
1686,OF THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIT BUT SHE HAS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ON TO THE SUN
1687,AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVANT ACT EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
1688,OCEAN REIGNED SUPRAIN
1689,ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETH OF THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE AUGURIAN METROPOLIS
1690,IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT EMY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
1691,WOULD NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
1692,ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
1693,TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LITENAT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORMED DEPTH AFROM FORTIFIE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SIGHT OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACE LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITHEATRE
1694,YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALJERIA AS YOU IMAGINED
1695,AFTER PONDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
1696,ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARON OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
1697,NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN AND DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARDS THE NORTH
1698,AT ANOTHER TIME HARALD ASKED

1862,BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE BEINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY
1863,IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED ANY IDEA OF HER

2027,UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRINT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOON BEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OBJECT AND YELLOW FLAG STONES
2028,RILLON WASHED FOR SOME TIME AT THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNSILL OF SLUMBERS OF MANICAMP WHO SNORED AS IMPARISLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT

2052,AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL
2053,THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLE IT IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
2054,WHY IT COLLIE OF THIS USUAL THE MOVE CRIED PEERING IT
2055,IS AHEAVE A GREATEST FOR GENTING INTO PHODE CORNERS
2056,FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED HER TANDLES AND STURY THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER PAT THE WAY IN SOME ARD TORNER
2057,WELL AND CONFINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
2058,NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVED ON OF WAILING IN HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NON IN REALITY
2059,I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED IN SALL CAFFOR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WALL IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BY A HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
2060,ONRURY SAID A DISTANT VOICE
2061,NO SOUND BROKE THIS STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
2062,THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BILL WILDER CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHY HAD BEEN SAID
2063,WHAT WAS THAT
2064,WHY THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEAR DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
2065,NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
2066,IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
2067,I AWOLE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING HATH FIRST IS SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CALF FR
2068,A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
2069,A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS A WAKE WHERE
2070,SETTING OTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS VULTURES CAFFER
2071,I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
2072,IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD HIM MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLORED
2073,I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEING WILDERED
2074,WHAT THAT IS CALFER'S LIFE
2075,I KNOW HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING
2076,I REMEMBERED SAYING HALF WE BEEN TOGETHER
2077,WOLL CHAIR PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
2078,I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
2079,A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
2080,I HAD AGAIN DID ACTING ON THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
2081,PERCHANCE TOO CALFFOR'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
2082,MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LAUGHED ME
2083,MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
2084,MY OVER RAUDINER SHIELD IT OUT LAST
2085,FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED YOU NOTHING DISTINCTLY
2086,THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
2087,TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN AFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN ARE DESIGN A
2088,BY REASON AND AFFECTION
2089,AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MERRY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELEGATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN ARREPARABLE INJURY
2090,THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF OUR CONTINENTS GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLAISANCY AND THENISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND TAKE CESTS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE
2091,SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
2092,THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY REALIZED PARTLY UNCONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
2093,IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING OF ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNA TILL WE ARE GONE
2094,BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
2095,IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SAICURING THEIR AFFECTION CAN NOT BE ORRATED
2096,TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN INHABITS OF SOME ORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
2097,DELA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MEREA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
2098,NOW TELLIA AND TRIVE TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND A SENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
2099,TO GET IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
2100,YOU HAVE COME AND DELA AND DELAWA WAS THE NAME OF JAMES STALL TO MAKE ROSALIA A VISIT
2101,I AM VERY GLAD
2102,I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND ELLA SINCE SHE WERE HERE LAUSED
2103,THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOWER ALTERED TONE HAS SHEEP IN A GOOD GIRL JANE
2104,FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAIN UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYETHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
2105,THEY WERE NOW PLAIN WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOUR
2106,DELIATE CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN ANNER OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SET TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAF AND DELA AND GROVESLY HEAR AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
2107,SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY UNTITTO FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS RUTH TO THE PIAZZA THERE
2108,SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PUITE THINGS SEEING
2109,WAS THESE PLEAS THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING OF OUTCHERLEANIN THEM OUT
2110,AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
2111,NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
2112,THAT HE IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
2113,THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
2114,VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING

2214,IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAMES AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTAIN CAVALIERS
2215,IN THIS WAY THE FED OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FET ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEAR IN THE BREAK THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS WHOLE WERE ALL LISTENING

2226,THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY FIXED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWLS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES AND TO NEVER HOUR IT
2227,IN FACT HE HAD JUST MINISHED THE LASTS OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAIMED GULLET WHEN THE BABOLD HAWK CAUSED SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
2228,THE HALK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPBRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED

2338,AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NNNNN PIERRE OF MARCHESTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LUGARITHMS THE PARSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUST LEAD YOU THEN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED
2339,WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD NOT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING UNION WITH THE ENGLISH POLIMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PROVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS HUNDRED TAKING A LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS IN CLINE
2340,THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPENED TO MONTTROSES COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL COALS IN SCOTLAND
2341,FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS OR PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL COALS AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCOVE WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
2342,DREADING THIS SUPERIOR POWER OF OUR GOL WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VESSELS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROES HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE Y GAIN THE MOCKEY OF HUNTLY AND THE GORDENS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS
2343,THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR PANISCOL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOMINITARY PROWESS AND OFTER SUM SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORST IT HE HEAR ALLOWED MONTROES TO ESCAPE HIM
2344,I QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THIS SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COMMON ENTERS
2345,WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOM AND UNDOOKED ALMOST WHOM HE HAD RECOLLED MONTROES FOUL SUDDENLY UPON ARGOIS'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR TEARING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHERBITANCE TO THE SWORD
2346,THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROES SOLEMNED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE AND THE MUSITIAGANS BECHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC COURSE OUR GYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUESTED THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETURNED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY IN THE LUCKY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM
2347,I A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MOURCH AMONG TROES HASTENED TO INTERLUCKY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF ATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT A FRAGENED COVEN ENTERS
2348,HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THE SEEMERGENTS APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
2349,MONTROES WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND OFTER PUTTING THE ENEMIES HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THAT WITH THE LOSS IF THE GALLANT LORD GORDEN ON THE POCT OF THE ROYALISTS
2350,FROM THE SAME MAN NEW REGIMENTS AND TO NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MINITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HUNDS AS THE INDEPENDENCE COULD RELYON
2351,BESIDES MEMBERS IF PARLIAMENT WOULD WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS UNTHEN WEARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT TO PUTTING ME ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
2352,THERE THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER POLIMENTARY ARM IT WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMONDERS
2353,VALOR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE POLIMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERSING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BUT SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING
2354,HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN MIGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANYTHING BUT THE HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CUNNUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS
2355,HE PASSED THROUGH HENDLY SNAWBONS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HURROW ON THE HILL
2356,THE SCULTISHIE GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THEN THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SIT A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
2357,THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PONIMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE'S TREATY WITH THE KING
2358,OR HATH HE GIVEN US AND IN GIFT
2359,AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL AUNTS AT THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TURNED PART SOME KING THEN WE HAVE ALSO BULL RIGHT IN DAVID BEN YE WHY THEN DE G DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
2360,ANOTHER PREACHER OFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT HORDERED THIS SONG TO BE SOME
2361,THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT SUM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
2362,HAVE NARCILORED ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
2363,THE GOOD NATURED ODIONS IN PITY TO FULL AND MAJESTY SHOWFUL ONE SCRIED HER DIFFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SOWN THE SOMME WHICH THE FORMER HAND COLD FOR
2364,THE PONDEMNENT AND THE SCOUTS NATE THAT PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
2365,BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PONIMANS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SKING WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
2366,THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEING PREVIOUSLY ASSHOWED RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM CONTWILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SANG MEASURE HALF STRENGTH INTO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFFEND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFFEND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFFEND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFFEND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFFEND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFFEND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFFEND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFFEND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFFEND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST OFFEND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY
2367,IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANKON AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY POSSED IN SONS WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
2368,HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
2369,THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPIE US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
2370,BUT WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL ANGRY HANTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORLETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY AND DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
2371,WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MY SEEMEN OVER STATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT I DOES APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
2372,AND WAS SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
2373,THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HIGH POTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG IT TO BEING A FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WHAT THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A HOLY UNREAL PAST
2374,ALL THAT I'M DEARING IS TO USE ITS LODGICAL TENABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
2375,THE BEHAVIOUR US TO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY AND MAKING THE RECORD
2376,HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIOUS FILLS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TYPES
2377,BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE HIS WARNTED
2378,OUR COMPINENCE OR LACK OF COMPETENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
2379,WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRANCE FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
2380,SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FILL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FILL STRANGE
2381,A MILLIORITATE AS A FILLING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
2382,IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FILL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
2383,I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO THE COW FER OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
2384,THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
2385,IN ACTUAL FACT THEIR ART DAULAS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED IF IT
2386,THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FILLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY AS CONCERNED
2387,THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT KNOWING THE TEMPERAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EFFECT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING IT THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
2388,IT WOULD SEEM AND THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FILLINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPERAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FILLINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED AFFENCE
2389,IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
2390,REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMPLING OR RELATED TOO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
2391,SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN US FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY IT MUST ARRIVE AT
2392,IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN AND ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE
2393,THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
2394,WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY TO FIND MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH AN ATHONITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEMATE WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE AT TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS THE IMMEDIATE SEA
2395,THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
2396,A GRAMAPONE BY THE HELP OF SEITABLE RECORDS MY RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRANDMATHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
2397,I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO YOU FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
2398,THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
2399,SIMON'S TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
2400,THEY GIVE WALLS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PASS OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
2401,IT IS THIS THAT IS AVENTERESSED TO FURY OF KNOWLEDGE
2402,IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT HAS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
2403,WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEASE US TO SEARCH AT THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEAVES US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
2404,THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FIELDING A FAMILIARITY ALONE
2405,A FURTHER STAGE AS RECOGNITION
2406,HER RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAT A HABIT OF A SOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN ADDITORIAMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
2407,BUT WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT AS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION AND THE FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SINCE OF THE WORD
2408,THE SKNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY AND ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
2409,THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS AN ADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE DIRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THEN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
2410,THAT THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING THAT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LENGTHS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
2411,THUS IF I RECOGNIZE THE THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION THE RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
2412,OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WHEREDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PERMATIVE AND ARE QUITE ANCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS IT RECOGNITION
2413,I REMAIN THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER AND ANOTHER LIGHT
2414,HAD EVER CROSSED WELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BAN STILL A COLLEGE HAD SIR CANNITON OBLE REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNET AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED AND STOPPY MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A RADIANT FOR THE FINAL THE PARTURE OF MILD FRIEND
2415,ON ARRIVING I HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I SHOWN THAT OUR SALON WAS FILLED WITH THE BRILLIANT COMPANY
2416,AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK IT SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
2417,I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROPRESSING AND THIS DISSIN QUARTER OF THE WORLD
2418,WE HAVE OUR LITTLE SHRUGGLES YEAR IS ESS WHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WATER
2419,WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN DOT ALAX SAID MY WIFE
2420,QUITE SATISFIED SAID EVER
2421,THE LADIES AND COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC OR ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD ASKED TO BE MANAGED OR ON THE OTHER
2422,NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW
2423,THEIR MASTER SAID MISSUS NEVER BEND
2424,I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTLECKS THE TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
2425,MISSUS NEVER BEEN YOU MUSTN'T DEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON
2426,JACK HAVE BEEN STANDING IN THE FOUR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVER AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES

2428,I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO PRESS WELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DIAM POOR THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
2429,THIS I FELL WAS PAY TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVOURED TO BE HATE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BE FIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT A FIELD AS SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY WORDINARY LIFE
2430,MY WIFE ON THE SPIRIT THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMAN A VERY GOOD DINNER
2431,THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH THERE
2432,THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
2433,OH YES AHA JACK AND I'M NOWHERE
2434,BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY ENDINGS BEFORE LONG
2435,OF WHAT MISSUS NEVER BENT HAD GONE THROUGH AN PROVIDING BIRD'S BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF PARTS AND JELLYGES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS
2436,WE SAT WITH THE OFFICER SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHORE
2437,HOW MUCH OF EVIL OF REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DOING THE LAST FEW DAYS
2438,WELL CAN I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
2439,AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAM COULD NOT ALAS
2440,WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FURTHERS SIDE TO THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SECLUSION WHAT I AND MY DAYS
2441,JACK WOULD BECOME EVER SHAPPY HUSBAND THEN WOULD REMAIN AMISSED THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
2442,THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
2443,MISTER NEVER BENT BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT THEY CANNOT BE DEMIDED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
2444,YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESY IN HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STAND SO HIGH
2445,IT IS A DUTY SAID I
2446,LUGGYR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE YIELDING TO IT
2447,NOT A DOW BUT HAD YOUR FORCE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TROUBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND AT MY DUTY TO SHRUGGLE WITH YOU
2448,THAT'S ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVER BEN SAID SIR FERDIN AND NO BROWN

2452,I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TRIGGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BOAR
